                In the book we learn how Kalam started his career in Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) and
                was involved in the design of a hovercraft. Later he moved to Indian Space Research which was the brain
                child of Vikram Sarabhai. In 1963, Kalam went to NASA facility in Maryland(USA) as part of a training
                program on sounding rocket launching techniques. There he came across a painting which depicted Tipu
                Sultan's rocket warfare against the British.
                The book covers a lot of "behind the scene" information and technical details about India's satellite
                and missile program (SLV-3, Prithvi, Agni, Thrisul, Akash and Nag). This might interest technically
                inclined readers but is sure to put off.</p>

            <p>Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban is an
                autobiographical book by Malala Yousafzai, co-written with Christina Lamb. It was published on 8 October
                2013, by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the UK and Little, Brown and Company in the US. The book details the
                early life of Yousafzai, her father's ownership of schools and activism, the rise and fall of the
                Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in Swat Valley and the assassination attempt made against Yousafzai, when she
                was aged 15, following her activism for female education. It received a positive critical reception and
                won awards, though it has been banned in many schools in Pakistan.</p>

            <p>The Diary of a Young Girl, also known as The Diary of Anne Frank, is a book of the writings from the
                Dutch-language diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family during the
                Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in
                the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. The diary was retrieved by Miep Gies, who gave it to
                Anne's father, Otto Frank, the family's only known survivor, just after the Second World War was over.
                The diary has since been published in more than 70 languages. First published under the title Het
                Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni .</p>

            <p>Unbreakable by M.C. Mary Kom could have been the story of any woman living in rural India. For a majority
                of Indian women, life is a struggle – a struggle to follow their dreams, a struggle to assert their
                rights, a struggle to make ends meet. What sets her apart is the sheer grit with which she faces every
                hurdle, and her determination to not let her struggle go in vain.</p>
